  Differences are reported as one or more change records. Change records have the following structure:

  N - indicates a newly added property/element
  D - indicates a property/element was deleted
  E - indicates a property/element was edited
  A - indicates a change occurred within an array
  path - the property path (from the left-hand-side root)
  lhs - the value on the left-hand-side of the comparison (undefined if kind === 'N')
  rhs - the value on the right-hand-side of the comparison (undefined if kind === 'D')
  index - when kind === 'A', indicates the array index where the change occurred
  item - when kind === 'A', contains a nested change record indicating the change that occurred at the array index
